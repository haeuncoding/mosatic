# Mosatic

Mosatic is a Javascript app that allows users to create pleasant and fun music with just their computer keyboard.

# Background

This music app is a way for anyone to make music, with preprogrammed chords and percussive elements that are mapped to keys on a keyboard. It will feature a variety of sounds, though it will be focused on more soothing and calming sounds, as well as more “cute” sounds. Each key, in addition, will have animations associated with it as well. The app will also feature a recording aspect where it will take note of keystrokes, as well as the length of time between each keystroke. It will replay the animation associated with each key, as well as the sounds.

# Functionality & MVPs
In Mosatic, users will be able to:
- Play a variety of sounds using a computer keyboard
- Be able to playback what they create both musically and through the animations.
- Be able to create a cohesive animation using their keystrokes.
- They will be able to layer sounds and animations.
